EEG Eye State Classification

The classifier takes 14 ElectroEncephalogram measurements as input and predicts whether the eye of the person is open or not.
Support Vector Machine Classifier in sklearn with kernal = "rbf" and parameters gamma = 1000000 and C=100 was found to give the best results and hence was used.

The Data Set used to train the model contained 10,000 training and 2,000 testing images and was taken from the UCI ML Repository.

The resultant accuracy score was found to be greater than 97.0%.

The Confusion Matrix is as follows

Confusion matrix:

                     Eye Closed (Predicted)   Eye Open (Predicted)
Eye Closed (Known)             1070                   19
Eye Open (Known)                21                    890

(By definition a confusion matrix is such that Cij is equal to the number of observations known to be in group i and predicted to be in group j)
